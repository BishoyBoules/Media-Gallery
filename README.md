# Media-Gallery
extracted photo links from an API and showing some of them (4 columns, 50 photos each) and also showing the photo's title <br>
every photo is clickable and when clicked you will get a bigger size of the same photo and a description <br>
I used gulp to control the workflow and automate it. I used JavaScript (ES6), HTML and CSS (Sass)
